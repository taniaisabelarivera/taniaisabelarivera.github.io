### CPSC 120

* Lab 1

    This was my very first lab and my first time coding in C++. It was also my first time using GitHub and had me learn how the test checks worked. I struggled a bit with figuring out the ropes(especially with doing everything in the Google C++ format), but I had a good time nonetheless. Besides, who doesn’t love an iconic “Hello World”?
* Lab 2

    This lab is particularly close to my heart because the person I worked on it with ended up becoming a very good friend of mine. It also felt very satisfying to code something more complex than a “Hello World” on my own, despite it still being elementary.

* Lab 12

    I loved doing Lab 12 part 2 because it felt like I was finally programming something with a visible outcome. Although we were able to code semi-useful but cool programs before, this one was able to make a gif that we were able to see.
